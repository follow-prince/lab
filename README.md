## Creating a New React Project

### Windows and Linux

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Install `create-react-app` globally. This is a tool that sets up a new React project with a basic configuration.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

3. Create a new React project. Replace "my-react-app" with your desired project name.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

4. Navigate to the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open a browser window with your new React app running.

6. You can now begin building your React application by editing the files in the `src` directory of your project.


### Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
